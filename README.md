# I Have Put The Creature Into My Gun

Created for Ludum Dare 56, with the theme "Tiny Creatures". [Ludum Dare entry page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56/i-have-put-the-creature-into-my-gun).

Just a lil' platformer about a bunch of lil' guys.

## [Play it here! (Web, HTML5)](https://jezzamon.itch.io/i-have-put-the-creature-into-my-gun)

## Controls

- Arrow Keys to move
- Z to jump
- X to shoot
- Shift to switch guy

Note: There isn't a proper "you win" screen, but there is a special ending place you can make it to if you're clever enough.

The game has half-baked support for WASD but there's no good button for shoot right now. Let me if you have any ideas!

Also Azerty sorry for the awkward z & x controls. I'll try to get button mapping as a post-compo tweak.
